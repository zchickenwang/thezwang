            He enjoyed walking in the morning. For him, Paris was most beautiful at four or five, the only two hours during which the city sleeps&mdash;when even the last of the lone drunkards have been shooed from the bars hobbling to their slumber, and when only the earliest of the fruit and fish merchants prepare for the day in torrid silence, bound by their Sisyphean state. He was always tickled by the notion of stealing a nice fat, cold peach from the street vendors' carts left unmanned and unseen, a carelessness caused yet also saved by the low icy fog which dulled every action and numbed your heart.
        </p><p>
            He liked the morning because he could hear footsteps&mdash;namely, those of the few people on the street: the slow rhythmic crunching of the mesh-clad garbage collectors; the soft, faintly irregular pads of a lone drunk-weary boy; the occasional crisp clacks of white-collar shoes that pierced the frigid space, so loud you could hear them anywhere within five or six blocks. He particularly enjoyed the sound of his own footsteps. They made him feel like he was going somewhere, doing something. He was most awake then, taking in strength and vigor with each long paced stride and each stiffening icy breath, spurred onward by the measured muffled taps of his feet on the hard morning ground.
        </p><p>
            On this particular morning, he was wearing worn in sneakers that made pleasant staccato thumps on the moist street, blackened by water. It was almost 5:30, the air had the frosty but pure quality unique to the few hours after a storm, and he wore a slim black trench coat with a black linen scarf. His train was parked at Gare Saint-Lazare, which was only two metro stops away from his apartment. He descends at Villiers and quickly catches the first metro of the day. He liked the metro then because he was alone on the train, except for the few early passengers who used neither ears nor eyes. By the time he arrived Gare Saint-Lazare was already beginning to warm up, with a small crowd forming for the six 'o clock departures.
        </p>

            It was around seven when he arrived in Giverny, stuffy and eager to escape the hot metro air made heavy and wet by urine, sweat, and lack of space. The air outside was a morning air cold and moist; the overcast sky was white and filtered the light of the rising sun so that the small town and the heavy morning fog that lay on it were bathed in a pale shimmer. The train station was perched right over the old tracks below whose iron was smooth and black from use, carving a thin deep abscess in the ground like a river through rock. 
        </p><p>
            He looked around for a cafe and found a small hut with a high wooden-planked roof.  The interior was a dimly lit square room with a bar taking up half the space and a few small tables squeezed in. The ceiling was arched and high but only appeared half its height from lack of light. It was one of those cafes where everyone there was old and hunched over and already knew each other, and where your presence feels as a knife does cutting through butter. The waiter came and he ordered a caf&eacute; allong&eacute; and asked if there were any patisseries, of which there was only one sad croissant at the bar, so he drank the hot coffee and ate the dry pastry while he looked up the path to Giverny. Having decided to walk the court two-or-so miles from the station to the gardens, he had read about an old traintrack-transformed walkway that ran parallel to the Seine and led straight to the impressionist trove. 
            
        </p><p class="xtra">

            At first there several well-placed signs directing the path to Giverny. They took him through the little cobblestone town on the riverbank and across the mirror-like river, on which the only ripples were the wake of the morning swans and were wide, arced, and slow. 
        </p><p>
            The signs ended abruptly at a small church with corners of gravestones peeking out from the sides, which was odd because the front of the church gate was adorned with signs pointing to every other landmark in the vicinity. After taking a suspiciously uneven road uphill, though, he managed to find the railroad tracks and the path hidden behind thick brush and guarded by clean metal turnstiles.
        </p><p>
            The path itself felt surreal&mdash;a seemingly endless road shielded on both sides by small hilled slopes, the entire scope of which was covered by a thick flowing carpet of green grass whose dewy strands were so bright they looked the same color and so long they curved at the half, breathing and waning with the wind creating some sort of map on the ground exposing each little current and gust. While the hill on the left was high enough to block whatever was behind it, the right side of the path revealed en plein vue the flat grasslands to the north, dappled with small square plots of farm and pastures with brown cows overshadowed by motionless cranes rising above the fog behind them. The path ran true as a stripe to the skyline and was pure and pristine, unblemished of human body, where the only dark silhouettes standing out of the thicket turned out to be control rods and sheets of scrap metal on the tracks. It was a strangeness in the air&mdash;odd only because it lacked the stenches of human society to which he had become accustomed: isolation, as fragile as the backs lithe of the grasses yet unbroken by boot and wheel. 
        </p><p>
            Nonetheless, he did encounter a few odd locals along the way. One was a stout old man, beard white and overgrown, with an old gait and a small white, long-haired dog who could have been a part of the man's beard donn&eacute; vie. The man looked weary and blind and the dog ran far ahead, waiting by digging holes along the way. He saw a small tourist group shortly after at one of the few intersections with the path; but aside from these fleeting, abstruse encounters that could have simply been tricks in his mind, he walked alone on this straight path leading straight to the horizon, with no one but the birds to share it.
        </p><p class="xtra">

            At the gates of Giverny he was greeted by a small construction truck with three workers paving a slice of the road. They looked like the modern day Gleaners on the sad pale landscape, visages blurred by the dust and fog. His only worry is that he did not bring his umbrella, and an updated weather report predicted rain there all afternoon. While he had planned on purchasing one somewhere in Giverny, the town is deserted&mdash;the homes, emptied by the cold winter, partitioned by rows of closed empty stores&mdash;all of which were fitted into a tight honeycomb structure, each cell outlined with short stone walls. It is even more quiet than in Paris, and he walks more softly so his footsteps won't be heard.  
        </p><p>
            The rare front door left ajar, exposing a dusty courtyard occupied by a formidable pile of branches and scrapwood that had been loosely tossed into the space. As if all the residents of the town had turned to trees and thrown themselves onto this pile of timber fit for a witch, leaving nobody to kindle their sacrifice. The door slightly propped was inviting as the apple of Eve was inviting, but he was not the eternal partner for whom they were waiting, and thus moved on. 
        </p><p class="xtra">
            
            First he saw a sign for the Mus&eacute;e des Impressionistes. The chalky patina of the Giverny streets clears, bathed under a filter of clear sunlight and fresh paint. The sign's bright red accents are as vivant as they are illusory, because written within them are the dates, like those on a tombstone, marking the museum's closure from August to February. Further down the street, a new poster on a plaster wall showcasing photos of the garden, the new temporaire chez Maison Monet. Across from it, the entrance to the house of Monet. He reads the plaque&mdash;closed. A bitter death to the day's plans, anticipated and disappointing. 
        </p><p>
            He walks once around the complex like a thief surveying a bank. The museum and the garden are separated by a small street. The interiors are well-hidden behind stone walls and thick vegetation, but the walls are stocky and short to preserve the quaintness of the countryside. He pauses, hand instinctively feeling the top of the stone&mdash;yet whatever was in his mind is cut off by voices inside the museum. He hops up to briefly glance two gardeners planting shrubs outdoors. A turn around the corner that reveals a side entrance to the museum, a small metal gate propped open on a small white truck whose back is open and packed with various flowers and young trees. He doesn't see anyone inside, but distant voices render his innocent intentions too risky.
        </p><p>
            He walks around the museum once again like some ritual, pondering on his next moves. While he liked that he was alone, there was not much to do, and he had given himself six hours here before his train back to Paris. He had to make the trek back to the station eventually, but things were not so interesting there either. And still no place to buy an umbrella. 
        </p><p>
            Eventually, he decided to explore Giverny a bit further, having taken the time to get there. The hope aloof of a local cafe or gallery still open. At least something to draw. 
        </p><p class="xtra">
            
            But there was no piece of society still alive to be found, and the cobblestone courtyards with their willows and white benches paled in the shadows of the dead hay-stacks and water-lilies. Little wriggling roads took him all the way to the edge of town, which was not very far. Strips of farmland lay on the border which rose steeply to become the wild hills beyond. As he approached the end of the road, the rocky cement under him turned to soft dirt; ahead of him, a straight path rose up the hill and into the outskirts&mdash;recognizable only through a few metal railings scattered along the slope like arrows on the back of some beast of before whose shaggy fourrure had turned to grass. The top of the hill looked closer than it was, and at the top he found a path which wound around the hill giving an open view of all the little roads and homes, with bumpy plains as far as the eye could see, or just up until a point in the distance where miles of mist blend the faraway bushes and clouds into an amorphous band on the horizon that resembled more  a splotchy watercolor.
        </p><p class="xtra">
            
            The horse startled him out of his trance. Perhaps it was its striking paleness, a white that pressed its presence onto the valley and sky behind it, which became soft pastel blotches; perhaps it was the pin and needle detail on the animal which was a white dagger in the background; or perhaps it was simply the creature's presence which felt as foreign and sublime as the first person you see after years lost in the desert, an aura that deafened without making a sound. 
        </p><p>
            Regardless, he found the point on the path closest to the horse, but they were still separated by a waist-high fence strung with three lengths of barbed wire. The horse stood without movement except for its neck which swayed up and down between mouthfuls of grass. It stood tout seul above the town and valley behind it, and he scanned the farms to make sure there were no workers present. Nobody was. After some contemplation, he shed his pack and left everything on the path. There was a plank of wood lying by the fence that he used to step over the wires, and as he approached the horse stopped grazing but was too old to be startled. 
        </p><p class="xtra">
            
            The first thing he noticed was its hoof. The horse's left front ankle had been bent backwards and lay flat on the ground, evidently now a substitute for the hoof which was cracked and moldy from lack of use. The skin on the front of the ankle had been rubbed raw from being used as a sole, which at this point had already rendered the animal unable to move. Limited so, it had eaten all that it could reach, paving a circle of clean dirt surrounding the wounded beast. While it continued to reach its neck muddy roots were the only reward, and the fresh grass for which it longed no longer ventured into the ring, like hungry ants waiting on a beetle to collapse before they cover and consume its dying flesh. It seemed all the life had been sucked out of the animal and whatever will left in the beast had retreated into its small heart; the rest of the body had collapsed on itself, the skin sucked inwards by some unimaginable force until the only resistance was either bone or skin from the other side. Devoid of nutrients, the stomach had eaten itself leaving deep recesses on the sides and draining the white from its hair. He went up and felt it, and what at first felt as familiar as pomade-laced mornings turned suddenly to bone and toothpick, his eyes sucked into the vortex of black and white barbs that now coated the animal, so bereft of nutrients the Devil himself had found asylum there in its dark crevices. He turned away repulsed and lamented whatever beautiful things that once lived in its sheer snowy coat who would not return. 
        </p><p>
            Pity the animal doomed to serve out its last starving days a scarecrow; he cursed those who would deliver such a fate and who would leave their death unseen, and as these dark thoughts possessed him he pulled some fresh grass from a couple steps away and fed it to the horse which grabbed it eagerly but as eagerly as it pulled at the weeds. He looked into the sad eyes which were not sad but jaded and saw the endless black pupils of the wise old man crouched in the gutters they call God.

            A propos to the occasion, he felt he needed to furnish the animal with some better nourishment. He found some in an abandoned truck with its back open and its hind wheels half sunken in a dark cakey slime that surrounded the area around the back like a moat of mud protecting the treasure of the truck, which was a pile of dry hay. He waded through the moat and returned with two large handfuls of the hay and fed it to the horse, who ate it happily but in the same way it ate the wet weeds. 
        </p><p>
            Having delivered upon this final obligation he took his pocket tool, equipped with a four inch blade akin to an old razor, well-buffed, and held up the horse's chin as he gently guided the length of the blade in an arc across the neck. The animal did not start to shake until well after the cut was made, by which time the blood that fell from the cut in an almost perfectly smooth sheet of scarlet had formed a small pool oozing through the soil amongst the thick weeds. Soon afterwards its legs gave way and it shrunk down onto the side with the short leg. He could not hear his own breathing nor the broken gasps of the beast, but he felt that they must have been thunderous in this valley of silence. And although the animal struggled on, its legs were already collapsed, limp as they lay on one other as if assuming the death pose in advance; only the breast of the beast continued to shiver and shake. He placed his hand on the horse's neck while its thick, flowing blood made the earth black and fell down the hill like the shadow of a waning sun. 
        </p><p>
            Applying a little pressure he felt slow, sporadic shudders, as careless as the tips of grasses moving along with their stems rocked to and fro by the rivulets of blood, and he felt these tremors in its neck and could not help but tremble a little himself.
        </p><p class="xtra">
            
            It was only after a few long minutes that the horse died. But the eyes of God are not easy to smother, and the skin of the Devil is not easy to drown. He stood up and surveyed the corps. The eyes were locked in death&mdash;the neck dyed crimson, arching back towards the tail. Its legs had not moved since they first fell, crumpled upon one another, seemingly posing for Pieta while even their stiff white fur became cold and hard as marble.
        </p><p class="xtra">
            
            There were no encounters on the way back. By the time I arrived at the train station, the sun was roasting and I was well tired of walking for the day. It was only around four, which meant three more hours until my train, so I bought a ticket for the next departure to Paris leaving in half an hour and used the three euro in change to get one of those petit handrolled cigars you see at all the tabacs now.
        </p><p>
            Anyway, the town was quaint and I discovered a little high-walled courtyard with clean grass and little plaster statues. There's another student inside who asks for a puff of the cigarette, so we share the smoke and the cheap tobacco is harsh but not unpleasant. I look up smiling, thankful it will not rain, and I feel 
        </p><p class="un">like a mass murderer, 
        </p><p class="un">hiding in public. 
        </p><p class="deux">Nobody recognizes me,
