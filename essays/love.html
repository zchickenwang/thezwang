        <h2> A Roundtable on Desire Starring Plato, Turgenev, Nabokov, and Freud </h2>
        <h3> 13 August 2015 </h3>

            They say time flies like an arrow. Forward, straight. If such is the case, then desire is that arrow's dream of reversing direction, of returning to a past&mdash;smiting the hand that released it, and breaking out of the straightforward path in which idiomatic expression has trapped it. Indeed, this paper aims to show that desire is a force which operates backwards in time, and which seeks to re-attain what Plato referred to as an "impossible origin." Like the arrow splitting from the hand, desire is borne from an original separation to which every individual yearns to return. Across different philosophies and narratives, this "primary separation or loss" as Butler calls it, takes different forms: what Turgenev calls "first love" is Freud's "repetition compulsion" and Dostoyevsky's "eternal husband";<sup>1</sup> yet the true motive and object of desire&mdash;namely, to relive a critical past event&mdash;is a message common to all (Butler 379). Unfortunately, attempts to return to this previous state of being ultimately constitute a fruitless endeavor. The attainment of the true object of desire is, in fact, a logical impossibility, and would negate the entire notion of desire. Yet despite asserting such a discouraging truth, literature manages to provide knowledge <span class="it">about</span> our failures&mdash;<span class="it">why</span> we desire an impossible origin, and <span class="it">why</span> our desire can never be satisfied&mdash;so that we may better know our desire, and through it, ourselves.
        </p><p>
            In order to understand the nature of desire, one must first understand its history. Thus, we will first examine Plato's <span class="it">Symposium</span>, which presents tales on the origin of desire and the circumstances of its birth. The <span class="it">Symposium</span> also serves to construct a foundational structure of desire&mdash;laying out a frame according to which the other texts can be read. From the <span class="it">Symposium</span>, we will specifically focus on Aristophanes' speech, which uses the figure of a myth to explain the origin of desire and its perception by the people.
        </p><p>
            Aristophanes' story begins with a description of an original state&mdash;one where human bodies are round and have eight limbs, rolling around the Earth. This state turns out to be situation that human desire seeks to reestablish&mdash;for humans would unsuccessfully assault the gods, and this rebellion would lead Zeus to split the beings into halves. This split, incidentally, becomes the original separation that creates the notion of desire in humans&mdash;their desire "emerges on the condition of division" (Butler 379). Aristophanes first introduces this concept of desire when describing human life after the separation&mdash;specifically, how people can find true love: "When a lover of boys, or any other type of person, meets that very person who is his other half, he is overwhelmed, to an amazing extent, with affection, concern, and love. The two don't want to spend any time apart from each other" (25). By "that very person who is his other half," Aristophanes is referring to the partner with whom the lover was one before the bisection, suggesting that human love is the desire to be reunited with one's true love. He makes the claim more explicit later: "The reason is that this is our original natural state and we used to be whole creatures: 'love' is name for the desire and pursuit of wholeness" (26). Aristophanes plainly states desire as the "pursuit of wholeness"&mdash;this "wholeness" being the pre-separation state of humans. Thus, Aristophanes asserts desire's aim of a past unity.
        </p><p>
            In the end, however, Aristophanes' myth is just that, and while it's underlying principles may compose the backbone for our understanding of desire, other, more realistic narratives are needed to bring these concepts of desire to life. One such story is Turgenev's "First Love,"" which contains a narrative in itself, Vladimir's recounting of his traumatic first love. The object of his first love is Zinaida, an enchanting woman who commands a company of suitors. While Vladimir joins this company in the hopes of winning her heart, and while he does distinguish himself within the group, Zinaida is eventually revealed to be in an affair with Vladimir's own father. Vladimir is unable to fully understand and accept his horrific reality, and scarred from this experience, remains alone in old age, and without a significant relationship. In this case then, Aristophanes' original separation is manifested in Vladimir's first love for Zinaida&mdash;in particular, as Sigi Jottkandt explains, "the way first love offers nothing but the sublimity of a deep and lasting torment from which we never fully recover" (Jottkandt 38).<sup>2</sup> On Vladimir's failure to love again, Jottkandt comments that his first love "succeeds in fracturing the One into a Two," negatively affecting "all possible successive loves"&mdash;a more modern reference to Plato's originary split, and furthering the parallelism between the impossible origin and Vladimir's relationship with Zinaida (52). Moreover, Vladimir may not be alone&mdash;as Freud suggests in "Beyond the Pleasure Principle," noting that his patients' neuroses always "have as their subject some portion of infantile sexual life&mdash;of the Oedipus complex, that is, and its derivatives" (Freud 602). Vladimir's trauma is indeed an Oedipal triangle, and Freud claims that the traumas of many patients are rooted in "infantile sexual life," like the young Vladimir's loss of innocence with Zinaida and Pyotr, a perverse original loss of sorts (603). While Freud's compulsion for repetition deviates slightly from Plato's structure, we will later see that the two are shades of the same color.
        </p><p>
            Following his original split with Zinaida, Vladimir's desire becomes the need to relive this moment, the episode of his first love. Upon hearing of Zinaida's death he laments:
        </p><p class="quote">
            "As for me...what did I hope for, what did I expect, what rich future did I look forward to when&mdash;when with no more than a sigh, a nagging sense of loss&mdash;I said goodbye to the fugitive and momentary ghost of my first love?
            <br />
            And what has come of all that I hoped for? And now, when the shadows of evening are already beginning to stretch over my life, has anything remained fresher or dearer to me than the memory of that brief thunderstorm of feelings in the springtime morning of my days?" (22, 202)
        </p><p>
            Here, Turgenev introduces the opposition between past and future&mdash;Vladimir's hopes for a "rich future" are thwarted by the "nagging sense of loss" he feels for his first love. Zinaida's "ghost," whose connotation is not at all "momentary," continues to haunt Vladimir; in the second half of the passage, Vladimir admits that his first love still remains his greatest source of pleasure&mdash;he clearly desires his past, and longs for the "thunderstorm of feelings" that had swept him up in youth. Scattered throughout Vladimir's story are comments on the unique, ephemeral joy of his first love,<sup>3</sup> and these serve to further the claim that Vladimir is doomed to always desire his first love but to never succeed in re-attaining it.
        </p><p>
            Before further analyzing the motives of desire in these texts, we will introduce one more&mdash;one not as realistic as "First Love," but whose message on the origin of desire is perhaps more poignant: Nabokov's "A Nursery Tale." <span class="it">One more</span> is an apt term to use indeed, as Nabokov's story chronicles the protagonist's journey collecting girls for his harem. While Erwin usually mentally chooses girls on the way to and from work, storing them in his mind, he is met one fateful day by the Devil, "who will tempt him, too, with the opportunity to gratify all his desire"&mdash;that is, allow him to truly possess all the women he collects the next day (Sweeney 513). As readers would discover, such an opportunity is too good to be true, and indeed, Erwin fails to meet the only stipulation given to him. The reason of his failure, though, reveals Nabokov's take on the nature of desire. When chasing the thirteenth and final girl, his main prize, Erwin tragically discovers that "number thirteen [turns] out to be number one," the first girl he chose (Nabokov 172). While such a plot twist cleverly brings the story full-circle, it also suggests the backwards direction of desire&mdash;Erwin's chase is a manifestation of his intense desire, and his glorification of this last (and best<sup>4</sup>) girl represents his underlying desire for his origin. Nabokov alludes to the notion of desiring the past with the continual repetition of the phrase "fantasy, the flutter, the rupture of fantasy" (161). In placing it throughout the story, in key moments such as Erwin's final chase, Nabokov draws readers' attention back to the beginning of his story, where this line opens the narrative.<sup>5</sup> With the phrase itself representing Erwin's desire, Nabokov reinforces his implicit idea that desire draws us to our past, to our beginning.
        </p><p>
            What then, is this beginning? Had Aristophanes read "A Nursery Tale," what would he believe to be Erwin's impossible origin? Perhaps it is this first and last girl he collects that day, who prevents him from realizing his desire. Or perhaps his primary separation is, as Freud argued with Vladimir, related to Erwin's first love, or at least the closest he has ever come to love&mdash;that is, the first (and only) girl with whom he conversed. This would indeed be an impossible origin, as Erwin is rendered unable to speak to any girl ever again, unable even to look up at them in their proximity. Furthermore, the last girl that Erwin collects that night ominously repeats the same words said to him by the first girl with whom he spoke&mdash;another hint from Nabokov, signifying an unmistakable return to Erwin's beginning.
        </p><p>
            At this point, having established the object of desire as an unreachable previous state, corroborating Plato's ideas with the stories of Turgenev and Nabokov, it is then natural to seek an explanation for this phenomenon: why is it that we want to return to such a state? The reason given by Aristophanes is that of "wholeness," of reuniting the soul so as "to heal the wound in human nature" (Plato 24). "First Love," on the other hand, seems to imply that we seek to recapture the lost experience of first love, and of the trauma it leaves&mdash;a wound, yes, but more of a wound to the heart, perhaps even to the mind, rather than of the soul. Yet neither of these narratives supports a substantiated claim explicating the appeal of an origin. Nabokov's story is equally, if not more, enigmatic&mdash;why does Erwin unknowingly desire his past? Similarly, why is Vladimir obsessed with the memory of Zinaida? Perhaps he wants to regain Plato's "wholeness," the wholeness of hope and love and innocence that had been shattered by the debilitating truth of his love triangle. Or perhaps, like one who finds himself lost, confused, and unhappy, Vladimir desires the past as a way of asking "How did I get here?" to analyze his past in the hopes of repairing his future. However, these conjectures are just speculations, and fail to satisfactorily answer our question.
        </p><p>
            Freud offers a potential solution in "Beyond the Pleasure Principle." In studying war veterans, he noticed their tendency to relive their traumatic experiences, particularly in dreams, which had "the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident" (598). As to why his patients continued to reimagine and suffer from their traumatic neuroses, Freud was at first not sure, but he discovered an explanation in a game played by a young child. In this game, the child would tie a toy to a string and throw the toy out of his crib, eventually pulling it back in with the string. Freud believed the roots of this behavior as the child's frustration at his mother leaving the room, and thus throwing out the toys represents his repetition of his original trauma&mdash;losing his mom (albeit temporarily). Freud continues:
        </p><p class="quote">
            "The child turned his experience into a game from another motive. At the outset he was in a passive situation&mdash;he was overpowered by the experience; but, by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game, he took on an active part. These efforts might be put down to an instinct for mastery that was acting independently of whether the memory was in itself pleasurable or not. But still another interpretation may be attempted. Throwing away the object so that it was 'gone' might satisfy an impulse of the child's, which was suppressed in his actual life, to revenge himself on his mother for going away from him." (my emphasis, 600)
        </p><p>
            Freud suggests that the child's simulated repetition of his trauma signifies his attempts to gain "mastery"&mdash;the original trauma left the child reeling from shock, feeling powerless, and so by reenacting the scenario the child, and the veterans, "abreact the strength of [the trauma's initial] impression and, as one might put it, make themselves master of the situation" (601).
        </p><p>
            Freud's traumatic neurosis mirrors the original splits felt by the characters of the stories we are examining: the splitting of human souls and bodies in the Symposium, as well as Vladimir's terrible realization of his predicament,<sup>6</sup> both constitute traumatic experiences. Erwin's only meeting with a woman, and her cold rejection of him, can likewise be seen as Erwin's trauma. If so, Freud's theory to trauma should apply; Vladimir's narrative, then, indicates his desire to gain control over his experience&mdash;to finally hold some form of power over Zinaida, against whom he was always powerless, and perhaps his father as well, who also rendered Vladimir helpless and vulnerable.<sup>7</sup> While Zinaida is, besides the cause of his trauma, also Vladimir's greatest source of joy, Nabokov's description of Erwin's conversation with the woman yields only despair, which could explain his worse psychological state. Erwin's daily routine of collecting girls closely resembles the child's game Freud observed&mdash;Erwin uses his penetrating gaze to "know"<sup>8</sup> the women, indirectly reliving his traumatic experience while maintaining control: just as the string guaranteed the child safety, so too does physical distance provide for Erwin a riskless environment to play his game.
        </p><p>
            Freud continues to make points highly applicable to Vladimir and Erwin, as if they too were his patients at the time. For instance, in the previously quoted passage, Freud's second interpretation of the child's game is that of "revenge" on the perpetrator of the trauma&mdash;likewise, Vladimir emphasizes his "indifference" at Zinaida's death,<sup>9</sup> and Erwin turns to objectifying women, both revealing a defensive, vengeful reaction. Another possible reason for desiring the past Freud introduces is the search for knowledge. He writes: "The patient cannot remember the whole of what is repressed in him, and what he cannot remember may be precisely the essential part of it;" as a result, "he is obliged to repeat the repressed material as a contemporary experience," trying to discover the "essential part" (602). In this way, perhaps desire for a trauma, or origin, is simply desire for knowledge about that origin, knowledge upon which we believe our identities to be predicated; maybe Vladimir and Erwin are following their innate need to know themselves&mdash;Vladimir by putting his life in words, and Erwin by trying to understand the women he wants.
        </p><p>
            Freud thus supplies a psychological explanation for Plato's philosophy, providing some reasoning for why we desire an origin in our past. Yet the impossible attainment of this origin&mdash;the other half of Plato's theory&mdash;remains unanswered, and doing so is the logical next step we must take in the process of shedding light on the nature of desire. Otherwise stated, the question is: why are our attempts to attain our object of desire continually foiled? If the object of desire is returning to an origin, then this question seems silly&mdash;one cannot actually return to a past, and the arrow of time continues to fly straight forward. Similarly, if Vladimir's origin is his first love, and Erwin's his first encounter, then perhaps such events simply cannot be repeated, and the problem of desire is solved! To preserve this discussion, then, the object of desire should be clarified as some previous state of being. While this point of view arrives at the same conclusion, there will be more work to do along the way.
        </p><p>
            Interestingly, despite Plato's declaration of desire reaching for an "impossible origin," Aristophanes provides a possibility for the contrary&mdash;he raises the idea of Hephaestus offering to satisfy humans' desire: "I'm prepared to fuse and weld you together, so that the two of you become one" (25). Aristophanes also tells his peers that if they worship Love with enough fervor, Love "will restore us to our original nature, healing us and so giving us perfect happiness" (Plato 27).<sup>10</sup> Perhaps Plato too realized this anomaly in his reasoning, and so later on has Socrates address the issue. For Socrates, the fulfillment of desire is a ridiculous notion, and he sees Aristophanes' consideration of this idea as a fallacy; during his speech in the Symposium, Socrates declares that "the case of desire is necessarily desire for something which is lacking," since "if it isn't lacking, you can't desire it, surely" (Plato's emphasis, 39). Here, Socrates asserts the absolute impossibility of achieving desire on the basis of its definition. Indeed, if the object of desire only emerged from Zeus' split, then the reversal of that split would necessitate desire's destruction.<sup>11</sup>
        </p><p>
            Another scholar comes to the aid of Aristophanes&mdash;instead of Socrates' dismissal of Aristophanes' act of god, Seth Benardete provides a clarification of the Aristophanes' words:
        </p><p class="quote">
            "There lives on in the soul a longing for something that never can be figured out, let alone achieved. Aristophanes expresses this by distinguishing between being a whole and being one. Hephaestus...offers to melt two lovers together, but he does not offer to untwist them and put them back the way they were. Indeed, the unity Hephaestus holds out would obtain only in Hades where only ghosts and shadows are and there is no embrace." (my emphasis, 51)
        </p><p>
            In examining Plato's diction, Benardete argues that even Hephaestus' generosity would not have, in fact, satisfied the desire of the humans, since they would not have truly returned to the same original state ("whole" versus "one").<sup>12</sup> He also, perhaps unintentionally, calls attention to the deceptive nature of desire&mdash;that Hephaestus' act, which readers are led to believe satisfies the object of desire, is actually a misconception that would fail to yield total gratification. In her essay, Butler calls this illusion the "imaginary trajectory" that we perceive desire to take (379). This would also explain why desire fails to be realized&mdash;because our understanding of the path to achieving our desire is a mirage, rendering our attempts futile.
        </p><p>    
            Such an "imaginary trajectory" is most evident in "A Nursery Tale," which progresses with continuous forward movement. Just as Erwin is "lured...on and on" in his journey, so too are readers led on through the pages of the text (Nabokov 170). Erwin's numbering of the girls in his collection furthers the concept of forward direction. Yet while the frenzied Erwin senses his goal in his future, finding all the girls so that he may have them that night, he is unaware that his desire is, in reality, directing backwards. His imaginary trajectory urges him onward&mdash;even the trees seem to beckon him forward<sup>13</sup>&mdash;to a fulfillment he will not attain. Sadly, even after he fails in his pursuit, Erwin reverts back to his monotonous routine, "oppressed by the thought that tomorrow [would be] Monday," failing to realize the ineffectuality of his usual procedure (172). On the compulsion to repeat, Freud notes that "each fresh repetition seems to strengthen the mastery they are in search of"&mdash;however, while Erwin's self-perception is unknown, readers can see the stagnant cycle within which he is trapped, one that yields not progress nor mastery (Freud 611). Yet while Erwin is doomed to live within the pages of the story, each day as fruitless as the last, readers can flip backwards, leave Erwin's consciousness, and gain an objective view of his life.
        </p><p>
            Such an objective view is what allows readers to understand Erwin's desire, and the cycle in which it leads him; it is also what Vladimir hopes to gain from writing out his memoir in "First Love."<sup>14</sup> So then, if Vladimir can indeed view his life from an outside perspective, why does he fail in learning about his desire, and in attaining it? Perhaps the truth is simply too overwhelming. While a servant does finally explicitly tell Vladimir about Zinaida and his father, the young Vladimir described never truly acknowledges his reality. The ending gives some hope&mdash;in "[feeling] terrified" and "[wanting] to pray," the implications of his first love seem to dawn on him&mdash;however, given Turgenev's desolate portrait of the old Vladimir, readers wonder if Vladimir ever did, or can, come to terms with his past (202). Freud would explain this problem by calling to attention the "inadequate stage of development which the child [Vladimir] has reached" when he suffers the original trauma (Freud 603). Zinaida being Vladimir's first experience with love, her affair with his father is crippling&mdash;Vladimir's consequent "loss of love and failure leave behind them a permanent injury to self-regard," an injury in which he, like Erwin, is trapped, and unable to escape (Freud 603).

            Jottkandt would attribute Vladimir's paralyzation to a slightly different reason. She argues that "in first love, there is no mysterious flower-turned hand stretching back as one gropes toward it in the dark," and that Vladimir is "unable fully to recover from the paternal cut of castration" (38, 45). Because of the imbalance that defines first love (Zinaida's power over Vladimir),<sup>15</sup> and because of "the Turgenev man's" stained relationship with his father (Vladimir's loss of his love to Pyotr), Vladimir is incapable of moving on past his trauma. Any closure he might have hoped to gain was forbidden by Zinaida's death before his visit.

            Yet there is another, broader explanation as to why human desire remains unachievable, and for that we turn back to the Symposium. In Aristophanes' story, without the enlightenment given by Hephaestus, humans would not know their object of desire to begin with. They can "only obscurely [hint]" at "what they want" (Plato 26). The object of desire's obscurity entails Butler's assertion of its "imaginary trajectory"&mdash;since we don't actually know what we want, our minds are forced to construct an imaginary path that we believe leads toward a goal "that can never be figured out" in the first place (Benardete 51). Such a system of blind, wandering souls would indeed preclude the possibility of attaining one's desire. Butler expounds on this argument by suggesting that our ignorance of the object of desire extends to our inability to truly comprehend desire as a whole. She claims that language is simply incapable of directly explaining desire,<sup>16</sup> noting that Plato chooses to explicate desire through a figure, like that of Aristophanes' story. Truly, perhaps our understanding of desire is forced into "various modes of indirection" like the figure&mdash;"First Love" employs nested narratives to distance itself from the concept of desire, and Nabokov is likewise unable to arrest the nature of desire without the fantasy environment of Erwin's fairy-tale adventure (Butler 370).
        </p><p>
            Yet even if language does "set limits on the representability of desire," as Butler suggests, the various forms of narratives and analogies on desire given by literature still compose a substantial base of knowledge on desire's nature (Butler 370). This repository alludes to desire's aim of returning to a past, to some primary separation from which our desire emerges, and the torch carried by Turgenev and Nabokov is still kept alive: even Harry Potter, a keystone of my generation's youth, echoes their message&mdash;Harry, whose original separation is his parents' death, sees his parents in the Mirror of Erised, the mirror that reveals one's true desire. Rowling's reference to desire for a past origin is furthered by the name "Erised," which is "Desire" backwards. But while it is not too difficult to perceive these qualities of desire in fictional stories, believing in such governing principles in our reality is far more challenging. Given the teachings of these authors, what are we supposed to do differently? If the true object of desire is forever unsatisfiable, even unknowable, then what is the point in trying to figure it out, in pursuing a question with no solution?
        </p><p>
            Upon a shallow contemplation of modern society, however, one begins to notice the Erwins and Vladimirs amongst us. One example: basking in exponential technological growth, we have come to enjoy, admire, and expect even greater advances to come. This ravenous thirst for progress, and the constant achievements that further fuel it form a wild cycle, at the center of which lies an unstoppable need to move forward. But is it possible that we have all become Erwins, greedily collecting each new gadget and anticipating the next? We await the announcement of each new iPhone every year with the same blind devotion, never doubting its ability to deliver the happiness we seek; but are we leading ourselves on an "imaginary trajectory" to failure? If this is the case, then what was the original separation that gave us this desire, and what is it's true object? A more frightening question is whether awareness of desire's true nature is even enough to break out of the cycle, or if we are just doomed to remain as desire's galley slaves&mdash;trapped within its pages&mdash;and now, doomed to know it.

            1 While not discussed in this paper, Freud provides an example of a repetition patient as one "whose love affairs with a woman passes through the same phases and reaches the same conclusion" (Freud 604). This description holds a striking similarity to Velchaninov's classification of so-called <span class="it">eternal husbands</span> and <span class="it">wives</span>, and to Velchaninov himself.

            2 Soren Kierkegaard makes a bolder claim, asserting "that only the first love is the true love" (Jottkandt 38).
        </p><p>
            3 After Zinaida's kiss, the old Vladimir admits "the feeling of sheer bliss which [he had] experienced at that moment has never once been repeated in [his] whole life" (Turgenev 177).
        </p><p>
            4 Erwin "[knows], without seeing her face, that she [is] his main prize" (171). 
        </p><p>
            5 This phrase also envelops the first chapter.
        </p><p>
            6 Vladimir's subsequent dream about Zinaida and Pyotr further align him with Freud's observations.
        </p><p>
            7 Ironically, Zinaida and Pyotr have died when Vladimir writes&mdash;thus, he now has complete control over them; they only live on through his portrayals of them as characters.
        </p><p>
            8 The quotation here serves to acknowledge the discussion of vision as an instrument of obtaining knowledge.
        </p><p>
            9 Vladimir quotes: "<span class="it">From lips indifferent heard I news of death, And with indifference heeded I the message</span>" (201).
        </p><p>
            10 Aristophanes suggestion of the god of Love repairing humans seems absurd if taken literally&mdash;instead, it should be understood, as with the rest of his story, as part of a figure on desire.
        </p><p>
            11 Butler reaffirms Socrates: "the fulfillment of desire would be its radical self-cancellation" (Butler 381).
        </p><p>
            12 Benardete provides another reason: that our purity "is forever lost... diluted through sexual generation over the course of time," thus one no longer has a true partner, and the "soul-mate is an illusion" (Benardete 53, 55).
        </p><p>
            13 During his final chase, "the trees, vernal lindens, [join] the hunt: they [advance] whispering..." (171).
        </p><p>
            14 In writing about himself, Vladimir turns himself into a character, comparing himself to literary figures like Othello and, at one point in his narration, slipping into the third person.
        </p><p>
            15 Such an imbalance is reflected in Zinaida's apathy towards Vladimir: she admits that she "can't love people [she must]...look down on," and Vladimir inserts himself into this group of people (Turgenev 167).
        </p><p>
            16 Nabokov, too, paradoxically calls desire "that dipping line no words, of course, could describe" (166).
