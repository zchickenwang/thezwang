        <h1> The Birth of Modern Fashion </h1>
        <h2> A study of french-influenced European haute couture during the 20th century </h2>

        <p>
            

                    Perhaps equally as fascinating as the extravagance, fame, and allure of fashion today is the subject of its origin&mdash;the transformations undergone by couturiers, costume, and popular demand that have molded clothing into the modern age. As always, behind every great change in history stands key disruptive events as well as years&mdash;centuries even&mdash;of general trends: the seeds of a new world and the weather that nurtures them; as such, these conditions are as much of a focus for this paper as the change they induced.
        </p><p>
            Yet fashion is nothing if not a fickle mistress,<sup>1</sup> and her caprice demands that an examination of her history be focused within a reasonable time period.<sup>2</sup> To study the birth of modern fashion, one fundamental period is the first half of the twentieth century, which was witness to a revolution in the field. Before the dawn of the new century, the pace of fashion was slow and cumbersome, handicapped by its own system of social and industrial regulations. However new thoughts, new ways of life, and especially new freedom for women would permeate the world of couture, acting as both a simplifying force but also introducing a freedom of expression that continues to propel the industry today.
            </p><p>
            Moreover, au lieu of a simple recounting of history, this paper aims to study the relation of fashion with two sources of inspiration. The first is the new artistic milieu, spearheaded by art nouveau, surrealism, and the birth of abstract art, whose development mirrors, and is seemingly attached to that of costume. The other is historical influence, for in spite of all efforts to break from the past, history always finds a way to latch on to progress, and the changes seen in early twentieth century costume provide further evidence for the wheel of fashion&mdash;ideas and themes of a time long past, recycled to help construct the new.
            </p><p>
            Before delving into the time capsule at hand, it is necessary to first provide a general sense of both society and fashion at the time just before "l'aube de la r&eacute;volution." 
            </p><p>
            It is the late nineteenth century. Already there is a new air of freedom and looseness. The pouf, a cousin of the bustle, begins to lose its bulk. Women's gowns abandon volume for new slimmer forms; rather than using draped fabrics that accentuate a grand weightiness, couturiers begin to pleat skirts vertically. This provides the elegance of drapery and movement while also creating a very much vertical line, one that falls down naturally and elongates the form. However, a contrast of volume is still given by the layering of the double skirt, whose upper component is caught up to add some puff and airiness. Such a skirt was complemented by a tight bodice and jacket&mdash;further reductions to a simple vertical form. In a move reminiscent of Louis Philippe's regency, the fullness of the gown is relocated to the sleeves. This era also saw the advent of the tailleur, the tailored suit that begins to infiltrate women's costume. The tailleur, originally popular in England, also serves to highlight the continuing relationship between English and French society; in particular the English tendency for more severe, slimmer cuts whose migration from London to Paris foreshadows a new worldliness to come, one dominated by English influences in French couture. Moreover, the tailored suit speaks for a general desire to simplify town dress. After all, people's lives had become far more busy and active, creating a need for simpler, more practical leisure costume. Yet it is worth noting that attempts to do so were still mostly suppressed, and the skirt still falls all the way to the floor.
            </p><p>
            With the new century came a new sense of energy. This was la belle &eacute;poque, the era of extravagance, hedonism, and constant change in line and costume. Accordingly, the silhouette followed through the changes already hinted at in the previous years. It became softer and lighter, removing the stress on waist, much like the less accentuated waistline and soft falling costume of the Empire and Directoire styles, the neoclassical resurgence&mdash;a simple, austere line, reminiscent of the early Romans. The train disappears, as well as the collar. In a further similarity to the Empire style, the fitted skirt ends at the hem slightly spread out "like a flower"<sup>3</sup> at the feet. At this point, the tailored suit becomes universal, and there is even an easier-fitted walking suit that gains popularity.
            </p><p>
            In the first decade, there emerges a new "S" line, bringing a flat vertical front but emphasizing rather the curve of the backside. This silhouette recalls art nouveau's classic sinuous curve. However, by the end of the decade, change would usher in yet another line, one without curves. Here couturiers turned back to the Empire style once more, with a simple straight falling line, accented with a high waistline. The implications of such a line meant that the foot of the gown be as slim as the rest of the body. Thus arose a new form, dubbed the "hobble skirt" due to a round band of fabric at the hem that maintained the narrow form, rendering walking rather difficult. This thin, tube silhouette, accompanied by glamorous feather-laden hats, was mocked by critics for its characteristic mushroom shape&mdash;yet even they had to appreciate the elegance of the simple look. In attempts to facilitate movement, normal everyday skirts had inconspicuous slits or slight pleats at the foot, without compromising the line. 
            </p><p>
            More changes would follow. Rejecting the high collar on bodices, women adopted the kimono bodice, which appeared around the same time as a more supple line. Such simplifications extended to the other underwear as well: while becoming more elegant, women's underwear was deprived of details and ornamentation so that it would fit more easily under the tight skirts of the time. The slim cut even produced new fitter underskirts like the chemise-pantaloons. It was at this time as well that the petticoat entered the realm of undergarments. As skirts no longer needed bustles, the petticoat would no longer be revealed in the front, thus removing the need for intricate designs, as seen in the new underpetticoats. The outerpetticoat, meant for view when women gathered up their skirts, was rendered superfluous by the rise of hobble skirts that always covered the petticoat underneath.
            </p><p>
            In the years leading up to world war the female silhouette remained simple and straight, renouncing full volumes. Women begin to feel freer, complementing new softened textiles and bold colors resulting from faster dyes.<sup>4</sup> In these early stages of independence and activity for women, there is a trend towards feminization. One must keep in mind that despite the modernization of costume, fashion as a whole at the time remained "dedicated to female adornment." The belle &eacute;poque and art nouveau persevere, as do their intricate, rich, nature-inspired flowing curves reminiscient of the ornate motifs of Lalique.
            </p><p>
            In contrast to a progressively looser female image are the continued regulations on menswear. While men's costume deviates little from the nineteenth century, there are gradual simplifications that parallel those of women's dress. The jacket is worn more often, particularly in the classic "suit" of jacket, waistcoat, and trousers of the same material. Yet this was not appropriate formal wear, which still required a tailcoat or frock coat. Coats and overcoats were governed by a particular set of rules defining cuts and materials appropriate for various occasions&mdash;long, fuller woollens for traveling purposes, while slimmer fits and finer materials for elegant occasions. These rules were perhaps even more stringent regarding accessories, which were of utmost importance to accent the basic men's outfit; specifically, hats governed by social rules which continued to run along class divisions,<sup>5</sup> imposed on men at all times, along with a single watch chain, one ring, and inconspicuous cuff links.
            </p><p>
            However, men too would begin to relax and seek freedom in costume. Such a trend was no doubt spurred on by a new men's lifestyle&mdash;a far more active life, with travelling and sport. The bicycle is introduced, as is the English penchant for sporting. With sporting comes the desire for sporting wear, also coming from England. Country wear included tweed as a material, as well as boater and panama hats. These developments remind of the impressionists before: see Monet and Renoir's paintings of casual country life with panama hats and new casual boating clothes. Even children are given boating clothes&mdash;that is, the sailor suit: white and blue striped, square edged collar, straight trousers or pleated skirt. Such children's wear recalls those of the Second Empire, at the time of impressionism. Frockcoat-weary men begin to adopt the new dinner jacket, suitable for the country but forbidden in public.
            </p><p>
            Such is the setting for the drastic changes the fashion world would experience with the coming of war. Despite the dawn of the aforementioned trends, haute couture remained distant and divided. Fashion was dictated by several couturiers, with Worth still in power&mdash;but each couturier worked separately, with select clientele for whom each case would be conceived individually, resulting in wholly separate collections of individual creations. In terms of style, high fashion remained focused on rich ornamentation and material, working to perfect detail and finish.
            </p><p>
            The First World War would bring about as much change in fashion as it did in people's understanding of the world. The process of war itself requires severe changes in society: it saw the disappearance of grand couturiers that once held the ultimate power in costume. Without their decisions, their say in the direction costume should take, women were forced to become "mistresses of their own fashion," liberated from their usually complete dependence on high fashion's whims and regulations. Women would use this newfound freedom to change costume in order to serve their new needs, needs of a new time, centered on convenience and comfort. After all, being wartime, more and more women begin to enter the workforce, performing jobs in industry and society left vacant by the movement en masse of men to the battlefield. Thus they needed easier, looser dress that served both to provide practical costume for working, as well as to acknowledge the severity of the time and respect to the dead of war. The result: a simpler silhouette, stripped of the elaborate and ornate, of the extravagance of ribbons, bows, embroideries, and patchwork. At the same time, the skirt is finally shortened, breaking the "unity of line" in women's costume; paired with stockings and low shoes, this new look gave women a sort of working uniform. "Uniform" is an apt term here, since as a result of improved machinery, new artificial synthetic fibres, and the overall lack of elegance in wartime, costume becomes much less varied, refinement traded for uniformity.
            </p><p>
            One would expect that after the Great War, society would be itching to return to its previous indulgence in costume and pleasure. While this is partly true, many changes during the war were to last. Women, having gained a wider role in the main d'&oelig;uvre, happily adopted their new identity. Their contributions to society give them new rights, and what was once a harsh reality into which society was forced by the hand of war now became the preferred mode de vie. Gone were the trinkets of the belle &eacute;poque, and fashion turns to the functional. No longer emphasizing the breast and waistline, clothes fall more naturally. The corset is replaced by the new suspender belt, allowing more comfort and freedom of movement. There is a new fashion for women based on a "consciously young form," aided by new pyjamas and short-cropped hair. The latter practice prefigures the boyish "&agrave; la gar&ccedil;onne" movement of the next era, one spurred on by the rising talent and influence of a young Gabrielle Chanel.
            </p><p>
            Haute couture, returning after the war, frowned on these new tendencies. Yet their adamancy to return to pre-war conservatism was rendered futile without the power once accorded to them, a power now taken by a people who refused to turn back to the past. As a result, the established couturiers lost most of their customers, and brands like Doucet and Poiret hinged on closing. From their weakness rose a new generation of women couturiers developed during the war who now seized power&mdash;they are Chanel, Paquin, Lanvin, Vionnet, Schiapiarelli, and the like.
            </p><p>
            Yet with such dramatic shifts in society, there also came a great sense of uncertainty. And so it is that the two decades following the First World War were a time of experimentation, of exploring newly opened paths in search of a future. Therefore, as a result of this young society, haute couture looked back in its history, holding onto pieces from the renaissance, the eighteenth century, and the second empire like driftwood in a stormy sea. High society even forced various historical themes onto their private balls and gatherings. The last gasps of a dying past, final attempts to resist a new culture.
            For women now want the new, the "fashion of tomorrow," one that provides for modern dances, sports, and short hair. This is the era of modernity. New leisure activities like golf, tennis, motoring, and particularly, going to the beach to escape winter, gained prominence, creating a need for new costumes to serve this new active way of life. Thus, the new goal becomes lightness and comfort, to bring grace and elegance into the practical, almost utilitarian&mdash;then foreign territories for fashion. For women, this meant shorter and shorter skirts, continuing to understate a lower waistline while showing off the legs. Women begin wearing a sort of tunic, open at the neck and arms for movement, hem falling above the knee, continuing with low shoes.
            </p><p>
            The 20's, les ann&eacute;es folles, also saw the apex of Chanel's influence. Along with couturiers like Patou and Lelong, she brought about a new gar&ccedil;onne line intended to masculinize women's wear. Such an idea stands in stark opposition to everything before it&mdash;women would never have dared, nor wanted to dress like men&mdash;and its acceptance by the public acts as proof of the revolutionary spirit of the time. The concept stands as a culmination of the trend of women's power&mdash;taking positions from men, and celebrating their successes. This masculinization took the form of white silk shirts, ties, and tailored suits&mdash;staples of daily menswear, fitted for the modern woman. Even the men's straight coat and waterproof are transposed. The gar&ccedil;onne collections leave behind lace, embroidery, feathers, and complexity, introducing instead short and open evening gowns that are left free and unshaped, traits poignant in Vionnet's &oelig;uvre as well as in the straight lines and simplicity of art d&eacute;co at the time. Rather than "constructing a costume," these couturiers wanted simply to "clothe the body in textile." This unwinding of fashion extended to the new vogue of nightgowns, intimate and loose wear for relaxing, as well as silk underclothes and handy zip fasteners. Chanel also helped institute black and white as the main colors in fashion, furthering simplicity and nodding to Manet's milky dresses.
            </p><p>
            Such trends were set in a new society of worldliness. Of Texan shirts and Indian moccasins, peaking with the Exposition des Arts D&eacute;coratifs in 1925 that reaffirmed Parisian prestige in luxury and culture. Fashion itself permeated the music halls and cinemas, giving birth to a new subculture of performance dress and make-up, as well as the adoration and imitation of the best-dressed celebrities that inevitably follows.
            </p><p>
            The year 1927 saw an interesting turn in women's costume. Toward the end of the twenties, a few women couturiers enjoyed the height of their power: Vionnet for her bias cuts "moulding to the body," Lanvin for her elegance in formal gowns with embroideries, and Chanel for her magnetic but simple, understated black dresses. Yet in a sort of reaction to the sudden changes, they would revert back to an older sense of femininity, one inspired by antiquity. They adopted heavier, classical draperies, used classical muted tones instead of modern bright colors popularized by the likes of Poiret. Accordingly, the long evening dress reappeared, falling to the ground in a point at the back, albeit slightly shorter in the front.<sup>6</sup>
            </p><p>  
        This bridge between modern and classical would manifest itself in the work of new houses as well. Balenciaga, through soft, fluid drapes on basic geometric shapes, reemphasized the female figure, stressing a strong waistline and curves. On the other hand, Schiaparelli would pioneer new modes, taking heavily from modern art movements. She adopted the new surrealism, fitting it to costume in new bizarre ways of "wearable art." Recall her brassiere with outlines of hands, or the many variations of decorated gloves. Old and new come together, finding common ground in richness and elegance.
        </p><p>
            The Second World War would bring about even more change than its predecessor. While the occupation left haute couture starved of material and foreign clients, the liberation would bring fashion roaring back to elegance. Many French citizens, shamed from the events of the war and from the many Nazi collaborators amongst them, wanted to simply forget and reject the trauma, enveloping themselves, like after the First World War, in pleasure and costume. While the struggle between elegant formal wear and practical daily dress continued, the fashion industry as a whole underwent an almost complete modernization&mdash;couturiers open boutiques seeking larger audiences, the th&eacute;&acirc;tre de la mode showcases the first live models, and French couture regains international prestige. Specialization occurs: within houses this meant the partitioning of the creation process, from the couturier's sketches to designers' models to specialized departments based on material; for the industry, division occurs along lines of status, such as hand-tailored haute couture, highly mechanized pr&ecirc;t-&agrave;-porter, to new houses specific to lingerie, tailleurs, and shoemakers; even the concepts and study of fashion are specialized, separated by material for men, and by quality for women.
            </p><p>
            Yet despite all these new developments, fashion would only quicken its pace in the years to come, gaining widespread popularity and global reverence with the likes of Dior, Saint Laurent, Lagerfeld, and their contemporaries. Indeed for them, the early twentieth century laid the groundwork for the fashion industry to come. Its complete transformation of women's wear from bustles and layered gowns to simple lines and elegant draperies acts as a predecessor to the revolutions to come&mdash;Dior's new look, Saint Laurent smokings, ...
            </p><p>
            In analyzing the history of fashion, particularly the period explored in this paper filled with so much change and variety, it is easy to lose track of the big picture. After all, the first half of the twentieth century is only a crudely severed limb of the fluid body that is la mode, and as such, remains just as tightly interconnected with its past and future as it does with the world events and society of its time. With costume's relationship with visual and decorative arts, there exists a harmony and correspondence between different forms of creative thought, different modes of expression; an intimacy continued with Matisse's Ballets Russes and Saint Laurent's Mondrian and Van Gogh prints. With costume's reuse of its past, there exists an immortality of ideas, a certain Zen in creation&mdash;that silhouettes and lines never die, and that concepts are never truly lost through time, but simply manifest themselves in new forms.
