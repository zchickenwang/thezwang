            Attempting to produce a thorough examination of the &oelig;uvres of Edouard Manet and Edgar Degas would demand a level of commitment and passion apropos to a life's work. Yet if each of their pieces acts as a mirror to their selves&mdash;to their emotions, philosophy, psychology, and personality, then concentrating one's study on a few select pieces would yield individual detail while also providing a general sense of the artist behind the work&mdash;albeit perhaps only a partial one. Thus, this paper aims to dissect and analyze Manet's <span class="it">La Lecture</span> and Degas' <span class="it">Lorenzo Pagans and Auguste de Gas</span>, drawing comparisons and contrasts with which one can grasp the milieu of their time in a manner greater than the sum of their parts.
    </p><p>
    Before introducing these two works, however, it is necessary to first provide a general setting of the social, economic, and political spheres where these two titans would make their legacies. The decade following the 1848 January Revolutions, with the creation of the Second Republic and the subsequent rise of Napoleon III's Second Empire, bore witness to the giant peasant of realism stepping on the contemporary art world. Under the influence of Millet, and later Courbet, the prestige of art was bestowed upon the vulgar&mdash;the poor, the workers, and their livelihoods. Rather than trying to capture beauty in perfection, luxury, and elegance, the realists stood with the salt of the earth and found beauty instead in the rough, hard truth of these lives. Millet led the charge, surging to fame and prominence with works such as <span class="it">The Gleaners</span>&mdash;perhaps the most revered of his paintings&mdash;which depicts three peasant women collecting discarded hay who, in both their positions in space&mdash;with poses suppressed by the horizon&mdash;as well as their appearance reveal their true identities as beasts of burden, becoming one with the earth on which they toil and labor. Yet Millet raises these beasts to the heights of academic art, with all its classical tenets and subdued glory. His torch of democratization would be carried later by the up-and-coming Gustave Courbet, who would take this glorification of the people to new, socially revolutionary heights. In his infamous <span class="it">A Burial at Ornans</span>, Courbet picks up <span class="it">The Gleaners</span>' classical compositional references but instead bases his scene on one far more revered&mdash;that of the great David's <span class="it">The Coronation of Napoleon</span>. <sup>1</sup> In a declaration of independence, Courbet shifts the center of focus from the Emperor crowning his Empress to the disheveled and unamused gravedigger whose only concern at the moment is gauging whether the coffin will fit in the dark muddy hole&mdash;the true meaning of death, and the reality of his existence. 
    </p><p>
    While the eventual formation of the Impressionists did usher in a new era of artistic style, the slightly earlier Manet and Degas, who were already in prominence in the decade before the 1874 exhibition, simply took the preexisting dominance of realism in new directions. A propos to style, they would adapt the solid and grounded paint application of the realists to a freer, more dynamic reality. They kept parts of the realists' dark colors and earthy browns, but introduced more color and movement. Both artists&mdash;particularly Manet&mdash;also continued the realist practice of acute attention to composition and space. Manet, too, would even further refine Millet and Courbet's intricate references to antiquity. Along with the future Monet, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Van Gogh, they would even transpose Millet and the realists' anonymously-blurred and shaded faces and forms. In terms of subject, Manet and Degas carried the typically-realist adoration of the main d'&oelig;uvre&mdash;however as a product of their time, peasants and farmers would be replaced with shop-assistants, dancers, and prostitutes&mdash;the new suppressed classes, the poor and degraded of the modern city. 
    </p><p>
    These cities represent a crucial change in the era that gave birth to the two artists. Indeed, the 60's and 70's brought along a new sense of wealth, change, and excitement, with the advent of the train, bicycle, sailing boat, and a vast array of new forms of leisurely enjoyment: a new feeling captured notably by Charles Baudelaire in his 1863 "The Painter of Modern Life", from whence the notion of modernity, of always being conscious of living in modern times, was born. Baudelaire used three terms to describe his modernity: ephemeral, fugitive, and contingent&mdash;these would later become the three pillars of impressionist thought and inspiration. Indeed, the modern painter according to Baudelaire was charged now with the task of capturing the essence their time, of updating their art to the current&mdash;that current being their constantly shifting and liberating sense of life. To Baudelaire's cry Manet would respond, taking his realism to shocking, modern scenes. In his first big dent on art history, Manet presented audiences in the Salon des Refus&eacute;s with <span class="it">Le D&eacute;juner sur l'herbe</span>, whose vulgar, provocative subject and ambiguous message immediately sent flags flying. Later that year, his <span class="it">Olympia</span>&mdash;an unabashed, honest, and bold portrait of a prostitute, would re-inspire controversy and change. But perhaps his adoption of Baudelaire's principles can be most clearly seen in a lesser-known work, the older <span class="it">Music in the Tuileries</span> which brought rococo's f&ecirc;tes galantes and bright colors to modern times. Manet's quick, loose brushwork echoes the ephemerality and spontaneity in style described by Baudelaire; his snapshot of the scene, cropping figures entering and leaving the party, represents the fugitive&mdash;that both the people and the party will end; and lastly, his rather jumbled placement of figures, a truthful composition that embraces the disorder and caprice of reality, aligns with Baudelaire's modern contingency.
    </p><p>
    Despite a close friendship with Manet, Edgar Degas stood apart from much of the pre-impressionist thought embraced by the former. Having undergone a rigorous classical education in Italy, studying in the strict style of Ingres, Degas used his clean realism to accentuate the psychology inherent in his works. He borrows from both the classical masters as well as the realists before him, and like Manet he would bring new subjects to the realm of art with <span class="it">L'Absinthe</span> and other paintings of the modern fallen woman, surrounded by the corruption and vice produced by the city. Nevertheless, before his alignment with the impressionist cast, Degas began with careful portraits, including the famous <span class="it">The Bellelli Family</span> which depicts his aunt, her husband, and two daughters in Italy in exile. This piece exemplifies two traits Degas would embrace: a carefully reasoned and planned composition, as well as the use of multi-character portraits in which he can use differences in figures&mdash;age, appearance, profession, placement, and of course, gender&mdash;to create tension in the scene, and to reveal more clearly subtle differences in their personalities and thoughts. It is only later, with the rise of the impressionists, that Degas would shift his focus to contemporary life and the psychological and social effects of its unforgiving nature.
    </p><p>
    Having outlined the foundation that would both give birth to and be broken by the artists to come, focus can now be directed to the selected portraits. <span class="it">Lecture</span> depicts Manet's wife Suzanne resting on a couch, eyes directed at the viewer while listening to their son Leon reading a lecture. Manet presents an intimate view of the room, placing his wife in a blatantly close position to the viewer. In eliminating the foreground,<sup>2</sup> Manet shortens the space between the realm of the viewer and that of the painting, thus quickly bringing the subject of the painting to the immediate attention of the viewer&mdash;a practice to be embraced by many impressionists in order to heighten the sense of movement and action, immersing viewers into the modern scenes they capture. Manet collapses the space even further by clothing Suzanne, the couch, and the curtain in the same pale silky cloth; this literally flattens the space, bringing the curtain in the background up to Suzanne's dress. Suzanne&mdash;particularly her dress&mdash;dominates the composition, her figure accentuated by the sea of bright fabric that surrounds her and frames her head. She rests at an angle, perhaps aligned on the axis between the plant on the left and Leon, but her face is ever so slightly turned towards the viewer. In contrast, Leon remains in the shadows, given a rather flat, profile view. He is framed instead by the murky background, the only significant dark patch of color in the piece. His looming presence in the margin seems to intrude on the space&mdash;in fact, as in the Degas to come, the composition here is so oriented toward Suzanne that classical thought would permit an elimination of Leon entirely. The contrast of Leon's sideline presence with the rest of the painting further pronounces his intrusion. However, no foreigner to classical rules and compositional balance, Manet offsets the spacial weightiness of Leon with the leafed plant on the left margin, the opposite corner. This plant's markedly outlined shape and half cropped, ambiguous position echo greatly of Japanese influence on western aesthetic&mdash;Manet's plant bears great resemblance with the towers and trees that dominate entire sides of Japanese wood-block prints, overlapping with all the spaces. This distinct form and the natural imbalance that it causes would appear in the works of many impressionists.<sup>3</sup> Yet here, the son counterbalances the plant's heaviness, and Manet avoids the strong asymmetry that inevitably results in the Japanese prints.
    </p><p>
    Manet's style is airy and light. He floods the room with a soft, bright light, creating a peaceful, soothing ambiance which represents a manifestation of his mood&mdash;that of relative prosperity, of contentedness with his family life. Typical of Manet's &oelig;uvre and those of many impressionists to come is bright frontal illumination; so bright, in fact, that even the darkest shadows&mdash;only tinted greys on the couch and ashy browns in the background&mdash;are but shades of their true intensity, paling in comparison with the black necklace and belt. However, the light here is a distant relative of that in Manet's other works like <span class="it">D&eacute;juner</span> and <span class="it">Olympia</span>, whose glaring brightness lacks the soft shadows of <span class="it">Lecture</span>&mdash;a key difference most notably observed in comparing the faint, cloudy chiaroscuro on Suzanne's face with the flatly-illuminated and starkly-outlined faces of Manet's other girls. 
</p><p>
A brief study of nineteenth century French costume would reveal that Suzanne is wearing a private, informal nightgown&mdash;one of the newer, more casual and comfort-oriented inventions of the time. Conventionally, Suzanne should have only been seen so lightly clothed by her closest company; but here, Manet chooses to display her to all his audiences, thus both quietly rebelling against antiquated social standards, as well as underscoring the calm, intimate aura that dominates the scene. Such a dress is treated with the softest of scratches, replicating the satiny shine and light flimsiness of silk, yet another token of his wealth. Despite using rather broad strokes of a looseness prefiguring a more broken impressionist stroke, Manet applies them with such delicateness that the dress seems to float up. Truly, Suzanne's hands appear weightless, lightly resting on the soft material. Her weightlessness is contrasted with the dense form of Leon, whose forward-leaning pose and powerful, straight arm cement down the couch and Suzanne, who seem otherwise in danger of simply floating away.
    </p><p>
    Manet's usual colors of choice are black and white, which he renders thick and milky with a satiny finish in most all of his paintings, notably in the mourning portrait <span class="it">Berthe Morisot of 1872</span>. Here, though, his favorite rich black is bestowed only on Suzanne's accessories, and with a lighter application. It's scarcity reveals Manet's priorities: prosperity and material happiness for his wife&mdash;indeed, interestingly, not even his son's dark figure and unlit background are worthy of his blacks. Correspondingly, Manet's normally bright, clear whites are tinted&mdash;Suzanne's dress has a soft blue glow, highlighted by greens and even grayed purples. The thinness of the dress is revealed through beige tones from the skin underneath. Suzanne's right arm and bosom are treated with the palest signs of green&mdash;natural, observed reflections from the plants around. Such a green, accented in the plant and Suzanne's eyes, could also take part in a soul-calming color palette inspired by tantric Buddhism, one wholly adopted by Monet in his water lily compositions. Yet <span class="it">Lecture</span> is still a portrait, and as such, calls attention to its figures. Like the girls in <span class="it">D&eacute;juner</span> and <span class="it">Olympia</span>, for which Suzanne partly posed, Suzanne here stares blankly straight at the viewer. But unlike the triumphant expression in <span class="it">D&eacute;juner</span>, Manet presents a melancholy, but more tranquil and contemplative look, befitting of one listening to a lecture, hinting of higher thoughts. Suzanne appears here in a sort of middle ground between Manet's loose, charged portrait of Morisot and the more grounded, quiet reality of his portrait of Emile Zola. Also reminiscent of the Zola portrait is Leon's basic pose: a static profile, as formal and stoic as that of Zola, recalling classical depictions of Greco-Roman officials and even coins. However, Leon exhibits a looser, more broken stroke to lighten the geometric rigidity of his position.
</p><p>
    Yet as always, Manet uses composition and style to instill a deeper commentary into his work, and <span class="it">Lecture</span> is no exception. Like his other portraits that feature Leon, Manet uses art to express his angst and frustration that he cannot publicly recognize Leon as his son. Look at Manet's <span class="it">Breakfast in the Studio</span>, which alludes also to Leon's rapid growth and newly burgeoning manhood. Indeed, in here too are embedded signs of his maturity. In the spirit of <span class="it">Breakfast</span>, Leon&mdash;while engrossed in reciting the lecture&mdash;exerts himself onto the scene with his strongly defined and shaded hand on the soft delicate couch, perhaps referencing his desire to become known, to enter society. Yet perhaps the most poignant signs of Leon's independence can be seen in comparison to the plant on the left: while the relationship between the two had been earlier defined according to spacial balance, their parallelism extends much further. Even on a basic visual level, the plant's uppermost leaf and pot hold a striking similarity to Leon's dark brown head and hand, respectively. Moreover, Leon's arms, hand, and book construct a silhouette not unlike that of the plant, and even his gray jacket&mdash;particularly towards the neckline&mdash;is tinted green. More abstractly, the maturing plant stands for the growth of knowledge and Leon's mental fertility. Both are kept inside, but seem to yearn for their freedom, to join the company of the other plants outside, visible in tangled, muted forms through the curtain. Not only are both kept indoors, but they also share identical cages: indeed, the plant's physical cage of the curtain mirrors Leon's symbolic cage of his mother's dress, both in similar fabrics, suggesting that Leon remains carefully tucked under his mother's wing. Furthermore, the plant's imprisonment seems to have embodied itself in the topmost leaf, which has become dried up and dying; could this mean that Leon too has become too mature to be kept inside any longer, that perhaps even part of his future is at risk? 
</p><p>
    While such subtle details are left at the reader's leisure, perhaps a similar analysis of Degas' painting can help shed light on these questions. Degas portrays his father listening to a well-known musician and friend, Lorenzo Pagans. While Pagans dominates the center of the portrait, Degas relegates his old, weary-looking father to the side, toward the back of the space. Indeed, much like with <span class="it">Lecture</span>, one notes here that given Degas' organization, the simple disappearance of Auguste&mdash;leaving just a portrait of Pagans, would still render the painting compositionally sound. As in Manet's piece, Auguste's sideline position seems trivial and forced, yet as with Leon, Auguste is actually the center for all the psychological tension and meaning in the work, as we will see. Before delving into a comparison between the figures, though, it is worth noting that Degas, like Manet and his fellow impressionists, uses the guitar here as a form which overlaps with the various spaces, thus bringing the foreground of Pagans immediately closer to the background of Auguste, and even to the piano in the very back, collapsing depth in a manner in tune with Japanese wood-block motifs.
</p><p>
    However, the real meat of this painting exists in the collaboration between Degas' precise positioning of figures and objects with his impressionist style, magnifying the subtle rifts he observed that separate the two subjects. Of course, many obvious differences form the foundation of this separation, including their age difference, their aforementioned compositional placement, and their poses&mdash;Pagan's vigor, with legs crossed and straight back, contrasts with Auguste leaning forward, resting his elbows on his knees.  Upon a brief observation of the piece, however, one notices that the faces and hands of the figures are the true objects of attention for Degas, and they serve him well: while Pagans' hands are dynamic&mdash;moving, playing his instrument, creating music&mdash;Auguste clamps his hands together, in thought or resignation, and they angle downwards in a pose stereotypical of old age. Oddly enough, Degas' orientation of Pagan's hands is one not unlike those of Auguste&mdash;imagine if the former's were juxtaposed next to the other's. Perhaps this correlation is a nod to Auguste; perhaps Edgar wants to remind viewers that despite their old age, his father's hands once did work too. Their visages provide more stark differences, with Pagan's dark moppy curls, strong mustache, and full lips making painfully clear to viewers Auguste's lack thereof, the latter supported only by thin, tired hair and a white mustache. His appearance is further accented with heavy bags under his eyes and thin lips curling into a crude twist.
</p><p>
    These internal and physical differences, while telling a story of their own, also manifest themselves in the external world, and here is where the magic of Degas lies. In the previous discussion of composition, we noted Auguste's inferior position. Yet he is the focus of the painting&mdash;how does Degas assert this? Perhaps the eye is drawn to Auguste because of the white sheet music on the piano behind him, which conveniently (and intentionally) frames his head, resembling a halo of sorts. Note that the juxtaposition of his head right in front of the sheets serves a function like that of Degas' guitar or Manet's plant: collapsing the distance between Auguste and the piano, creating the impression that his head and halo are on the same plane. The sheet music is a natural eye-catcher because it is one of the few places where Degas applies a strong white&mdash;indeed, the only other white patch appears as Pagans' chemise. His shirt outshines both the sheet music as well as Auguste's much older and tainted shirt, a stark contrast visible in the proximity between their cuffs. Moreover, Degas' use of white signifies something more; perhaps it is the vitality of youth and creation, which remains embedded on the breast and hands of Pagans, but whose creative presence has drained out of Auguste, relegating itself to a much more external, spiritual role. Pagans clear white chemise also brings out a more poignant contrast with his black tie, another sign of his professional, working role. But there is also a third appearance of white: in the pages of the books behind Pagans, whose natural, off-white hue distinguishes itself from the more metallic and cold tints of the book behind Auguste. Yet their most apparent difference is in state&mdash;that is, how Pagan's sheets are closed, lying in messy stacks. Does this mean that Pagans has not yet earned his halo, or that unlike the aged Auguste, he prefers action and liveliness to solitude, freely playing music rather than rigidly obeying to theoretical studies? This complementary duo of books for the two figures is paralleled in the pair of paintings above them as well. The one above Pagans shows more detail, with a broad light dab in horizontal blues&mdash;more lively than that above Auguste, but whose unfinished frame seems to represent that Pagans has much more to experience; ultimately, however, Degas' quick, mottled depiction of the paintings undermines any potential meaning they hold.
</p><p>
    Acute readers will have noticed the omission of the gaze so far from the analysis. After all, if the eyes are the window to the soul, then their gazes should be just as telling&mdash;if not more so&mdash;than the rest, and this is indeed the case. Pagans looks outward; his eyes are large and glossy, framed by full, long eyebrows and a thin ring of shading underneath which renders them ever so more sensitive. By contrast, the eyes of Auguste are thin and tired, revealing a pensive gaze underscored by their heavy bags and barely-present eyebrows. Pagan's upward searching eyes are counterbalanced by Auguste's lowered gaze, but they both appear aloof, with slightly open mouths, looking to a world beyond the one in which they sit. Their distant, thoughtful looks&mdash;a testament to Degas' expressive abilities&mdash;are perhaps intended to highlight the magical ambiance created by Pagan's music, which takes the player to the realm of inspiration, and the listener to a distant past. As a result, even the world around them seems to melt away&mdash;Degas captures the scene in a typical impressionist fashion&mdash;gifting detail on only what matters to him, while leaving the background in a roughly-applied haze. His minimalist, ephemeral touch leaves only enough detail to be sensible&mdash;a short white line in an unchecked patch of dark to stand for a piano. Remarkably, even Pagan's jacket fades into nothingness&mdash;his left shoulder is almost transparent, of a substance as fleeting as his song, allowing viewers to see the rather sharply outlined silhouette of Auguste's back that should otherwise not be visible. Pagans' coat hem and both figure's legs dissolve as well into the cloudy backdrop, a sienna mist that fails to even differentiate between floor and wall, in which the only strong lines appear in the wild, sketchy legs of Pagans' chair. Having been told by Ingres&mdash;whom Degas revered&mdash;that the key to painting is drawing "lines, many lines," these unrefined dark strokes are no doubt both important and intentional, and here they serve two purposes: to balance the dull, heavy mass of Pagan's legs, as well as to further accentuate his youthful strength and self-assertion.
</p><p>
     Degas' impressionist tendencies are furthered by the frontal light poured onto the scene, bathing the characters' faces and hands in a soft light, while reflecting more brightly off Pagans' shirt and guitar. The rest of the backdrop, with its earthy palette of browns, blacks, and yellows, continues the grounded realist tradition begun by the great Dutch and Spanish realist painters so looked up to by the new impressionists. His free stroke and loose application adheres to the tenets of modernity and impressionism, but whose ambiguity also provides the painting with meaning via symbolism. Because the forms are so barely distinguishable, the few objects on which Degas does give detail stand clearly apart. Moreover, though, the loosely defined shapes come to stand as symbols, representing not only their physical description but also their psychological roles assigned by Degas. Take the open sheet music, whose visual obscurity easily permits its double identity as Auguste's halo.
</p><p>
    However, having understood the many ways in which Degas expresses the physical and psychological tensions in this painting, one naturally wonders what the artist intended these signs to mean. As already mentioned in our discussion of Degas' work, he uses the figurative notions of music to convey emotion and thought&mdash;as if the beauty of Pagans' song has brought their innermost psychologies out onto the surface of their eyes. Degas, then, captures the vulnerability that music inevitably brings out of his father. Indeed, Pagans' guitar, which crosses the space, also structurally punctures Auguste&mdash;the instrument is placed as if going through his chest, and Auguste's curled lips and bent pose gives the impression that he involuntarily responds physically to the guitar as much as he does emotionally. Yet if the music does indeed puncture Auguste's soul, then what does it reveal? From the transposition of white from Pagans' chest to Auguste's head, one understands that the former's physically expressed creativity has matured into the latter's contemplative, philosophical thought&mdash;from playing music to composing it. Indeed, Degas adds the force and energy of red to Pagans' moving hands, yet bestows the same color on the top his father's head, implying a transition from physical to mental rigor. Such an affinity seems to imply that Pagans and Degas stand as images of the same person, just in different stages of life. Even physically, they are given the same mustache, strong nose, tender eyes, and colorfully accented hands. The aforementioned translucency of Pagans' shoulder furthers this notion, suggesting that the two cannot coexist but as ghosts, shades of their original selves. Does music then, re-inspire in Auguste the vitality of his youth? Such a claim would be supported by his gaze, directed straight at the headstock of the guitar, which is one of the only places graced by Degas with broad strokes of green. Perhaps the green's presence stands for the sickness of Auguste's old age, but it likely represents fruitfulness and fertility, the growth process. In this way, Auguste's contemplation takes him back to the greener pastures of his youth, a youth embodied in the flowers in Pagans' pocket and around his sound hole. If Pagans and Auguste are indeed defined by their temporal distance, rather than their difference in identity, then it would be a notion also explored by Degas in Madame Jeantaud in the mirror, where Jeantaud's grotesque reflection serves as a reminder from Degas that her beauty and youth are not to last, as ephemeral as the outfits she dons.

    Despite their chromatic polarity, <span class="it">Lecture</span> and <span class="it">Pagans</span> and Auguste are strikingly similar. Both portraits feature two figures whose differences are explored and expanded by the artist's composition, style, and technique. Whereas Suzanne looks straight at the viewer in a flat gaze, Pagans&mdash;her complement&mdash;looks far away, past the viewer and indeed seemingly past the physical realm of the viewer as well; however in both pieces, the other figure hidden in the back maintains a strong downward gaze that balances the upward momentum of the other. The two pieces are further similar in that in both, the two figures fail to make eye contact, and fail even to appear to acknowledge each other's presence. Indeed, Suzanne and Leon, just like Pagans and Auguste, seem to occupy wholly separate spheres of existence. Not only do they not look in each other's direction, but they are also more preoccupied with their own thoughts, in their own worlds. This latter observation can be affirmed with the already described style in which Manet and Degas paints the figures, and can be explained by the fact that in both pieces, another sense is at play: hearing. Spoken lecture for Manet and music for Degas&mdash;these are peculiar forces at work in the paintings; enigmatic because the medium of painting cannot capture sound, yet the effects of sound on the figures come to define the character of each portrait. Despite the visual separation between Pagans and Auguste, they are linked together by what they hear, and song unites them. The same is true for Manet; speech ignites a harmony between the characters that somehow transcends optical recognition.
</p><p>
    Perhaps the greater differences between the two works appear in the respective styles in which they were painted. As is usually the case, Manet and Degas showcase their various talents in full splendor. Manet, being known for his luscious blacks and whites, displays his skill in the soft white gown, whose faint shifts in tone reveal a very fine perception for subtle nuances in light and its effects on color. The strong yet smoothly mixed contrast with Suzanne's necklace and belt give Lecture the visually stimulating black and white pop typical of Manet. On the other hand, Degas&mdash;who shows the same colors in the costumes of his figures, fails to do so in a manner as sophisticated and exquisite as that of Manet. Indeed, the shirtfront of Pagans is rather bland; the blacks of the coats lack Manet's density and shine, and are not even very dark. Of course, this can be attributed to Degas' different style of painting: for him, the power in his paintings lay in their psychological depth, of which Pagans and Auguste is a potent example. Yet while much of the stylistic details in Degas' painting revolve around the psychological states of his characters&mdash;bodies not of flesh and bone, but of mind and memory&mdash;one perceives a marked difference in Manet's treatment of his characters' thoughts. In terms of visages, Degas manages to provide much more meaning and emotion in his figures' eyes and faces, whereas Manet seems to not be as invested, and his faces are less finely attuned to thoughts and personality. Suzanne looks somewhat plain, and her expression reveals little. While one may counter with evidence from Manet's more psychological portrayals of Berthe Morisot, other portraits of Suzanne, like Madame Manet at Piano, indicate that Manet generally fails to inject his wife with the thoughtfulness of Auguste. 
</p><p>
    Perhaps this is intentional, or perhaps it can be attributed to Manet's view on modernity. Perhaps Manet wanted his family portraits to represent a gentle prosperity, to smell of calm and quiet content&mdash;the new sense of happiness of his time, of whose portrayal he excels. Yet there is another explanation, which is that of the female image. Could it be that Suzanne is simply understood as a product of her household, and that the latter's peace and well being must be manifested in the former's stature and appearance? That women are forever tied to the domestic realms over which they preside&mdash;a notion that would be shattered with the new female perceptions of the twentieth century, but one which Suzanne seems to accept; she even sits on her couch as a queen would over her dominion, listening halfheartedly to a servant. Yet this concept is one that Degas rejects; in his female portraits, such as his aunt in The Bellelli Family and the model for L'Absinthe, women are painted which the same level of attentiveness, granted similarly profound expressions as their male counterparts.
</p><p>
    From the basis of their collective works, Manet and Degas would come to define their era of art. Manet, while not a founding member of the Impressionist group, would be considered more of a father to them&mdash;an honor commemorated in several of the Dutch-inspired impressionist group portraits, like those of Fantin Latour that depict Manet revered by his contemporaries. Indeed, Manet would develop close friendships with the founders, like Degas and notably Monet. His milky blacks and whites would become a standard to come, especially for Monet and the impressionists. But while Manet accepted and adopted the rise of Monet's style, Degas would gradually split from his cast. Even before 1874, Degas' classical education instilled in him values of spacial construction and painting technique that would remain uncorrupted by the freedom and looseness of impressionist standards, differences that would contribute to the gradual dissipation of the group. Whatever their personal differences may be, however, Manet and Degas remain as two of the most influential painters even today. Yet despite a general acknowledgement of their superiority, society does not provide much real explanation, leaving most people wondering why exactly these two artists, and these two pieces are worthy of the praise they have received: a natural response, and one upon which this essay has attempted to shed light&mdash;yet art embodies a mystifying and enigmatic character that somehow always evades words; some feelings remain in the dark, forever shrouded from the domain of language. And thus, perhaps it is indeed this hidden soul&mdash;like an unknown son in the shadows&mdash;that gives Manet and Degas immortality. That they not only sought to express something beyond just a painting, but that they managed to dip their brushes in the eternal essence of art, one that fulfills some fundamental yearning in the human experience, carrying a meaning even time cannot touch. And even now, at the twilight of his semester abroad in Paris, the author cannot help but be Auguste, soul full and weary of past adventures&mdash;relegated to pictures above his bed, framed remembrance of the joys of life.
